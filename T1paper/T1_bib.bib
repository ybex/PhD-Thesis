By performing read-out at the stable two electron D0↔D− charge transition we can increase the tunnel rates to a nearby single electron transistor charge sensor by nearly 2 orders of magnitude, allowing faster qubit read-out (1 ms) with minimum loss in read-out fidelity (98.4{\%}) compared to read-out at the D+↔D0 transition (99.6{\%}). Furthermore, we show that read-out via the D− charge state can be used to rapidly initialize the electron spin qubit in its ground state with a fidelity of FI=99.8{\%}.},

The high density of evanescent modes in the vicinity of metallic gates causes energy relaxation and a loss of phase coherence of electrons trapped in quantum dots. We derive expressions for the resultant energy relaxation rates of charge and spin qubits in a variety of dot geometries, and EWJN is shown to be a dominant source of decoherence for spin qubits held at low magnetic fields. Previous studies in this field approximated the charge or spin qubit as a point dipole. Ignoring the finite size of the quantum dot in this way leads to a spurious divergence in the relaxation rate as the qubit approaches the metal. Our approach goes beyond the dipole approximation and remedies this unphysical divergence by taking into account the finite size of the quantum dot. Additionally, we derive an enhancement of EWJN that occurs outside a thin metallic film, relative to the field surrounding a conducting half-space.},

abstract = {The spin of an electron or a nucleus in a semiconductor [1] naturally implements the unit of quantum information -- the qubit -- while providing a technological link to the established electronics industry [2]. The solid-state environment, however, may provide deleterious interactions between the qubit and the nuclear spins of surrounding atoms [3], or charge and spin fluctuators in defects, oxides and interfaces [4]. For group IV materials such as silicon, enrichment of the spin-zero 28-Si isotope drastically reduces spin-bath decoherence [5]. Experiments on bulk spin ensembles in 28-Si crystals have indeed demonstrated extraordinary coherence times [6-8]. However, it remained unclear whether these would persist at the single-spin level, in gated nanostructures near amorphous interfaces. Here we present the coherent operation of individual 31-P electron and nuclear spin qubits in a top-gated nanostructure, fabricated on an isotopically engineered 28-Si substrate. We report new benchmarks for coherence time ({\textgreater} 30 seconds) and control fidelity ({\textgreater} 99.99{\%}) of any single qubit in solid state, and perform a detailed noise spectroscopy [9] to demonstrate that -- contrary to widespread belief -- the coherence is not limited by the proximity to an interface.

Here we demonstrate single-shot variable-strength weak measurements of the electron and the nuclear spin states of a single {\$}{\^{}}{\{}31{\}}{\$}P donor in silicon. We first show how the partial collapse of the nuclear spin due to measurement can be used to coherently rotate the spin to a desired pure state. We explicitly demonstrate that phase coherence is preserved throughout multiple sequential single-shot weak measurements, and that the partial state collapse can be reversed. Second, we use the relation between measurement strength and perturbation of the nuclear state as a physical meter to extract the tunneling rates between the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}31{\}}{\$}P donor and a nearby electron reservoir from data, conditioned on observing no tunneling events. Our experiments open avenues to measurement-based state preparation, steering and feedback protocols for spin systems in the solid state, and highlight the fundamental connection between information gain and state modification in quantum mechanics.},

Metals have a high density of photon modes, and the fields spill out of the bulk metal because of the evanescent-wave component. Thus thermal and quantum electromagnetic Johnson- type noise from metallic device elements can decohere nearby qubits. In this paper we use quantum electrodynamics to compute the strength of this evanescent-wave Johnson noise as a function of distance z from a metallic half-space. Previous treatments have shown unphysical divergences at z = 0. We remedy this by using a proper non-local dielectric function. Decoherence rates of local qubits are proportional to the magnitude of electric or magnetic correlation functions evaluated at the qubit position. We present formulas for the decoherence rates. These formulas serve as an important constraint on future device architectures.},

We use single spin qubits associated with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to probe Johnson noise in the vicinity of conductive silver films. Measurements of polycrystalline silver films over a range of distances (20-200 nm) and temperatures (10-300 K) are consistent with the classically expected behavior of the magnetic fluctuations. However, we find that Johnson noise is dramatically suppressed next to single-crystal films, indicative of a substantial deviation from Ohm's law at length scales below the electron mean free path. Our results are consistent with a generalized model that accounts for the ballistic motion of electrons in the metal, indicating that under the appropriate conditions nearby electrodes may be used for controlling nanoscale optoelectronic, atomic and solid-state quantum systems.},

abstract = {Exploiting the two-point measurement statistics, we propose a quantum measurement scheme of current with limited resolution of electron counting. Our scheme is equivalent to the full counting statistics in the long-time measurement with the ideal resolution, but is theoretically extended to take into account the resolution limit of actual measurement devices. Applying our scheme to a resonant level model, we show that the limited resolution of current measurement gives rise to a positive excess noise, which leads to a deviation from the Johnson-Nyquist relation. The deviation exhibits universal single-parameter scaling with the scaling variable {\$}Q\backslashequiv S{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}{\}}M{\}}/S{\_}0{\$}, which represents the degree of the insufficiency of the resolution. Here, {\$}S{\_}0{\$} is the intrinsic noise, and {\$}S{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}{\}}M{\}}{\$} is the positive quantity that has the same dimension as {\$}S{\_}0{\$} and is defined solely by the measurement scheme. For the lack of the ideal resolution, the deviation emerges for {\$}Q{\textless}1{\$} as {\$}2\backslashexp[-(2\backslashpi){\^{}}2/Q]{\$} having an essential singularity at {\$}Q=0{\$}, which followed by the square root dependence {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}Q/4\backslashpi{\}}{\$} for {\$}Q\backslashgg1{\$}.

abstract = {All material bodies are surrounded by a fluctuating electromagnetic field because of the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the current density inside them. Close to the surface of planar sources (when the distance d {\textless}{\textless}lambda(T)=ch/k(B)T), thermal radiation can be spatially and temporally coherent if the surface can support surface modes like surface plasmon polaritons, surface phonon polaritons, or adsorbate vibrational modes. The fluctuating field is responsible for important phenomena such as radiative heat transfer, the van der Waals interaction, and the van der Waals friction between bodies. A general formalism for the calculation of the power spectral density for the fluctuating electromagnetic field is presented and applied to the radiative heat transfer and the van der Waals friction using both the semiclassical theory of the fluctuating electromagnetic field and quantum field theory. The radiative heat transfer and the van der Waals friction are greatly enhanced at short separations (d {\textless}{\textless}lambda(T)) between the bodies due to the evanescent electromagnetic waves. Particularly strong enhancement occurs if the surface of the body can support localized surface modes like surface plasmons, surface polaritons, or adsorbate vibrational modes. An electromagnetic field outside a moving body can also be created by static charges which are always present on the surface of the body due to inhomogeneities, or due to a bias voltage. This electromagnetic field produces electrostatic friction which can be greatly enhanced if on the surface of the body there is a two-dimensional electron or hole system, or an incommensurate adsorbed layer of ions exhibiting acoustic vibrations. Applications of radiative heat transfer and noncontact friction to scanning probe spectroscopy are discussed. The theory gives a tentative explanation for the experimental noncontact friction data.},

abstract = {In many quantum computer architectures, the qubits are in close proximity to metallic device elements. The fluctuating currents in the metal give rise to noisy electromagnetic fields that leak out into the surrounding region. These fields are known as evanescent-wave Johnson noise. The noise can decohere the qubits. We present the general theory of this effect for charge qubits subject to electric noise and for spin and magnetic qubits subject to magnetic noise. A mapping of the quantum-mechanical problem onto a problem in classical electrodynamics simplifies the calculations. The focus is on relatively simple geometries in which analytical calculations can be done. New results are presented for the local noise spectral density in the vicinity of cylindrical conductors such as small antennae, noise from objects that can be treated as dipoles, and noise correlation functions for several geometries. We summarize the current state of the comparison of theory with experimental results on decoherence times of qubits.

abstract = {We present our study of decoherence in charge (spin) qubits due to evanescent-wave Johnson noise (EWJN) in a laterally coupled double quantum dot (single quantum dot). The high density of evanescent modes in the vicinity of metallic gates causes energy relaxation and a loss of phase coherence of electrons trapped in quantum dots. We derive expressions for the resultant energy relaxation rates of charge and spin qubits in a variety of dot geometries, and EWJN is shown to be a dominant source of decoherence for spin qubits held at low magnetic fields. Previous studies in this field approximated the charge or spin qubit as a point dipole. Ignoring the finite size of the quantum dot in this way leads to a spurious divergence in the relaxation rate as the qubit approaches the metal. Our approach goes beyond the dipole approximation and remedies this unphysical divergence by taking into account the finite size of the quantum dot. Additionally, we derive an enhancement of EWJN that occurs outside a thin metallic film, relative to the field surrounding a conducting half-space.},

abstract = {We compute the electromagnetic fluctuations due to evanescent-wave Johnson noise in the vicinity of a thin conducting film, such as a metallic gate or a 2-dimensional electron gas. This noise can decohere a nearby qubit and it is also responsible for Casimir forces. We have improved on previous calculations by including the nonlocal dielectric response of the film, which is an important correction at short distances. Remarkably, the fluctuations responsible for decoherence of charge qubits from a thin film are greatly enhanced over the case of a conducting half space. The decoherence times can be reduced by over an order of magnitude by decreasing the film thickness. This appears to be due to the leakage into the vacuum of modes that are well localized in the perpendicular direction. There is no corresponding effect for spin qubits (magnetic field fluctuations). We also show that a nonlocal dielectric function naturally removes the divergence in the Casimir force at vanishing separation between two metallic sheets or halfspaces. In the separation regime where a local and nonlocal treatment are noticeably distinct, the Casimir attraction between two thin sheets and two halfspaces are practically indistinguishable for any physical film thickness.},

abstract = {In many quantum computer architectures, the qubits are in close proximity to metallic device elements. Metals have a high density of photon modes, and the fields spill out of the bulk metal because of the evanescent-wave component. Thus thermal and quantum electromagnetic Johnson- type noise from metallic device elements can decohere nearby qubits. In this paper we use quantum electrodynamics to compute the strength of this evanescent-wave Johnson noise as a function of distance z from a metallic half-space. Previous treatments have shown unphysical divergences at z = 0. We remedy this by using a proper non-local dielectric function. Decoherence rates of local qubits are proportional to the magnitude of electric or magnetic correlation functions evaluated at the qubit position. We present formulas for the decoherence rates. These formulas serve as an important constraint on future device architectures.},

We use single spin qubits associated with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to probe Johnson noise in the vicinity of conductive silver films. Measurements of polycrystalline silver films over a range of distances (20-200 nm) and temperatures (10-300 K) are consistent with the classically expected behavior of the magnetic fluctuations. However, we find that Johnson noise is dramatically suppressed next to single-crystal films, indicative of a substantial deviation from Ohm's law at length scales below the electron mean free path. Our results are consistent with a generalized model that accounts for the ballistic motion of electrons in the metal, indicating that under the appropriate conditions nearby electrodes may be used for controlling nanoscale optoelectronic, atomic and solid-state quantum systems.},

We also make the connection between these statements and the recent discussion of whether decoherence can be caused by the ZPF. The distinction is made between decoherence via making a real excitation in the environment and effects due to its polarization by virtual excitations.},

These states are of three types: orbital, valley, and spin. The relaxation times depend sensitively on system parameters such as the dot size and the external magnetic field. Generally, however, orbital relaxation times are short in strained silicon (from a tenth of a microsecond to picoseconds), spin relaxation times are long (microseconds to greater than seconds), while valley relaxation times are expected to lie in between. The focus is on relaxation due to emission or absorption of phonons, but for spin relaxation we also consider competing mechanisms such as charge noise. Where appropriate, comparison is made to reference systems such as quantum dots in III-V materials and silicon donor states. The phonon bottleneck effect is shown to be rather small in the silicon dots of interest. We compare the theoretical predictions to some recent spin relaxation experiments and comment on the possible effects of non-ideal dots.},

The results are shown to be consistent with relaxation via two-level systems (TLS's). The TLS's make transitions between levels by phonon-assisted tunneling and flip spins by modulating the spin-orbit interaction.

abstract = {Phonon-induced orbital and spin relaxation rates of single electron states in lateral single and double quantum dots are obtained numerically for realistic materials parameters. The rates are calculated as a function of magnetic field and interdot coupling, at various field and quantum dot orientations. It is found that orbital relaxation is due to deformation potential phonons at low magnetic fields, while piezoelectric phonons dominate the relaxation at high fields. Spin relaxation, which is dominated by piezoelectric phonons, in single quantum dots is highly anisotropic due to the interplay of the Bychkov-Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. Orbital relaxation in double dots varies strongly with the interdot coupling due to the cyclotron effects on the tunneling energy. Spin relaxation in double dots has an additional anisotropy due to anisotropic spin hot spots which otherwise cause giant enhancement of the rate at useful magnetic fields and interdot couplings. Conditions for the absence of the spin hot spots in in-plane magnetic fields (easy passages) and perpendicular magnetic fields (weak passages) are formulated analytically for different growth directions of the underlying heterostructure. It is shown that easy passages disappear (spin hot spots reappear) if the double dot system loses symmetry by an xy-like perturbation.},

A wide distribution of spin-flip times is derived from the single-phonon cross-relaxation mechanism for a dangling-bond interacting with the tunneling two-level systems of the amorphous interface. The temperature and frequency dependence is sensitive to three energy scales: The dangling-bond spin Zeeman energy delta, as well as the minimum (E{\_}min) and maximum (E{\_}max) values for the energy splittings of the tunneling two-level systems. We compare and fit our model parameters to a recent experiment probing spin coherence of antimony donors implanted in nuclear-spin-free silicon [T. Schenkel {\{}$\backslash$it et al.{\}}, Appl. Phys. Lett. 88, 112101 (2006)], and conclude that a dangling-bond area density of the order of 10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}cm{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} is consistent with the data. This enables the prediction of single spin qubit coherence times as a function of the distance from the interface and the dangling-bond area density in a real device structure. We apply our theory to calculations of magnetic flux noise affecting SQUID devices due to their Si/SiO{\_}2 substrate. Our explicit estimates of flux noise in SQUIDs lead to a noise spectral density of the order of 10{\^{}}{\{}-12{\}}Phi{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}} {\{}Hz{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} at f=1Hz. This value might explain the origin of flux noise in some SQUID devices.

abstract = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) offer a platform to explore the physics of quantum electronics including spins. Electron spins in QDs are considered good candidates for quantum bits in quantum information processing, and spin control and readout have been established down to a single electron level. We use these techniques to explore spin dynamics in a hybrid system, namely a QD coupled to a two dimensional electronic reservoir. The proximity of the lead results in relaxation dynamics of both charge and spin, the mechanism of which is revealed by comparing the charge and spin signal. For example, higher order charge tunneling events can be monitored by observing the spin. We expect these results to stimulate further exploration of spin dynamics in QD-lead hybrid systems and expand the possibilities for controlled spin manipulations.},

abstract = {Double quantum dots are convenient solid-state platforms to encode quantum information. Two-electron spin states can be conveniently detected and manipulated using strong quantum selection rules based on the Pauli exclusion principle, leading to the well-know Pauli spin blockade of electron transport for triplet states. Coherent spin states would be optimally preserved in an environment free of nuclear spins, which is achievable in silicon by isotopic purification. Here we report on a deliberately engineered, gate-defined silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot system. The electron occupancy of each dot and the inter-dot tunnel coupling are independently tunable by electrostatic gates. At weak inter-dot coupling we clearly observe Pauli spin blockade and measure a large intra-dot singlet-triplet splitting {\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 1 meV. The leakage current in spin blockade has a peculiar magnetic field dependence, unrelated to electron-nuclear effects and consistent with the effect of spin-flip cotunneling processes. The results obtained here provide excellent prospects for realizing singlet-triplet qubits in silicon.},

abstract = {A common observation in metal-based (specifically, those with AlOx tunnel junctions) single-electron tunneling (SET) devices is a time-dependent instability known as the long-term charge offset drift. This drift is not seen in Si-based devices. Our aim is to understand the difference between these, and ultimately to overcome the drift in the metal-based devices. A comprehensive set of measurements shows that (1) brief measurements over short periods of time can mask the underlying drift, (2) we have not found any reproducible technique to eliminate the drift, and (3) two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in the metal-based devices are not stable. In contrast, in the Si-based devices the charge offset drifts by less than 0.01e over many days, and the TLFs are stable. We also show charge noise measurements in a SET device over four decades of temperature. We present a model for the charge offset drift based on the observation of nonequilibrium heat evolution in glassy materials, and obtain a numerical estimate in good agreement with our charge offset drift observations. We conclude that, while the Si devices are not perfect and defect-free, the defects are stable and noninteracting; in contrast, the interacting, unstable glasslike defects in the metal-based devices are what lead to the charge offset drift. We end by suggesting some particular directions for the improvement in fabrication, and in particular, fabrication with crystalline metal-oxide barriers, that may lead to charge offset drift-free behavior. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {The silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) material system is technologically important for the implementation of electron spin-based quantum information technologies. Researchers predict the need for an integrated platform in order to implement useful computation, and decades of advancements in silicon microelectronics fabrication lends itself to this challenge. However, fundamental concerns have been raised about the MOS interface (e.g. trap noise, variations in electron g-factor and practical implementation of multi-QDs). Furthermore, two-axis control of silicon qubits has, to date, required the integration of non-ideal components (e.g. microwave strip-lines, micro-magnets, triple quantum dots, or introduction of donor atoms). In this paper, we introduce a spin-orbit (SO) driven singlet-triplet (ST) qubit in silicon, demonstrating all-electrical two-axis control that requires no additional integrated elements and exhibits charge noise properties equivalent to other more model, but less commercially mature, semiconductor systems. We demonstrate the ability to tune an intrinsic spin-orbit interface effect, which is consistent with Rashba and Dresselhaus contributions that are remarkably strong for a low spin-orbit material such as silicon. The qubit maintains the advantages of using isotopically enriched silicon for producing a quiet magnetic environment, measuring spin dephasing times of 1.6 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}s using 99.95{\%} {\$}{\^{}}{\{}28{\}}{\$}Si epitaxy for the qubit, comparable to results from other isotopically enhanced silicon ST qubit systems. This work, therefore, demonstrates that the interface inherently provides properties for two-axis control, and the technologically important MOS interface does not add additional detrimental qubit noise.},

abstract = {Quantum technologies represent a rapidly evolving field in which the specific properties of quantum mechanical systems are exploited to enhance the performance of various applications such as sensing, transmission, and processing of information. Such devices can be useful only if the quantum systems also interact with their environment. However, the interactions with the environment can degrade the specific quantum properties of these systems, such as coherence and entanglement. It is therefore essential that the interaction between a quantum system and the environment is controlled in such a way that the unwanted effects of the environment are suppressed while the necessary interactions are retained. This Colloquium gives an overview, aimed at newcomers to this field, of some of the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve this goal. A number of techniques have been developed for this purpose in different areas of physics including magnetic resonance, optics, and quantum information. They include the application of static or time-dependent fields to the quantum system, which are designed to average the effect of the environmental interactions to zero. Quantum error correction schemes were developed to detect and eliminate certain errors that occur during the storage and processing of quantum information. In many physical systems, it is useful to use specific quantum states that are intrinsically less susceptible to environmental noise for encoding the quantum information. The dominant contribution to the loss of information is pure dephasing, i.e., through the loss of coherence in quantum mechanical superposition states. Accordingly, most schemes for reducing loss of information focus on dephasing processes.},

The incorporation of a radio-frequency (rf) interposer enables the platform to be separated into two printed circuit boards, decoupling the simple board that is bonded to the qubit chip from the multilayer board that incorporates expensive connectors and components. This modular approach lifts the burden of duplicating complex interconnect circuits for every prototype device.

This challenge arises from the fundamental fragility of quantum information, which can only be overcome with quantum error correction.

In contrast to quantum process tomography (QPT), GST self-consistently and correctly accounts for state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. It therefore provides significantly more accurate estimates than QPT as gate fidelities increase into the fault-tolerant regime. We give a detailed review of GST and provide a self-contained guide to its implementation. The method is presented in a step-by-step fashion and relevant mathematical background material is included. Our goal is to demonstrate the utility of GST as both an accurate characterization technique and a simple and effective diagnostic tool. As an illustration, we compare the output of GST and QPT using simulated example data for a single qubit. In agreement with the original literature, we find that coherent errors are poorly estimated by QPT near quantum error correction thresholds, while GST is accurate in this regime.},

It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

This result attracted a lot of attention and controversy. The aim of this review article is to review the background to the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem, to provide a clear presentation of the theorem itself, and to review related work that has appeared since the publication of the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph paper. In particular, this review: Explains what it means for the quantum state to be ontic or epistemic (a state of knowledge); Reviews arguments for and against an ontic interpretation of the quantum state as they existed prior to the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem; Explains why proving the reality of the quantum state is a very strong constraint on realist theories in that it would imply many of the known no-go theorems, such as Bell's Theorem and the need for an exponentially large ontic state space; Provides a comprehensive presentation of the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem itself, along with subsequent improvements and criticisms of its assumptions; Reviews two other arguments for the reality of the quantum state: the first due to Hardy and the second due to Colbeck and Renner, and explains why their assumptions are less compelling than those of the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem; Reviews subsequent work aimed at ruling out stronger notions of what it means for the quantum state to be epistemic and points out open questions in this area. The overall aim is not only to provide the background needed for the novice in this area to understand the current status, but also to discuss often overlooked subtleties that should be of interest to the experts.},

abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) can overcome the errors experienced by qubits 1 and is therefore an essential component of a future quantum computer. To implement QEC, a qubit is redundantly encoded in a higher-dimensional space using quantum states with carefully tailored symmetry properties. Projective measurements of these parity-type observables provide error syndrome information, with which errors can be corrected via simple operations 2 . The 'break-even' point of QEC—at which the lifetime of a qubit exceeds the lifetime of the constituents of the system—has so far remained out of reach 3 . Although previous works have demonstrated elements of QEC 4–16 , they primarily illustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test the capacity of the system to preserve a qubit over time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded in superpositions of Schr{\"{o}}dinger-cat states 17 of a superconducting resonator 18–21 . We implement a full QEC protocol by using real-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode and correct. As measured by full process tomography, without any post-selection, the corrected qubit lifetime is 320 microseconds, which is longer than the lifetime of any of the parts of the system: 20 times longer than the lifetime of the transmon, about 2.2 times longer than the lifetime of an uncorrected logical encoding and about 1.1 longer than the lifetime of the best physical qubit (the |0〉 f and |1〉 f Fock states of the resonator). Our results illustrate the benefit of using hardware-efficient qubit encodings rather than traditional QEC schemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction from confirming basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system performance and the challenges in realizing a fault-tolerant system. Implementing QEC in the laboratory is challenging, requiring a complex system with many qubits. Even for a perfectly realized QEC system of finite size, there will always be unrecoverable errors or failure modes, resulting in an exponential decay of the information over time. In fact, error correction first introduces a hardware overhead penalty, because an uncorrected logical qubit consisting of n physical qubits (for typical first-order codes n ≈ 5–10; ref. 22) will experience decoherence that is of order n times faster. A central goal of QEC is to suppress the naturally occurring errors and surpass the break-even point, at which the lifetime gain due to error correction is larger than this overhead penalty. These considerations motivate exploring a hardware-efficient approach to QEC, with which it may be more tractable to not only overcome the entire overhead, but to pinpoint the leading limitations to fault-tolerance. The encoding of logical states as superpositions of Schr{\"{o}}dinger-cat states (hereafter, 'cat code') that we implement here is a hardware-efficient scheme that requires fewer physical resources and introduces fewer error mechanisms than do traditional QEC proposals.

Two-electron spin states can be conveniently detected and manipulated using strong quantum selection rules based on the Pauli exclusion principle, leading to the well-know Pauli spin blockade of electron transport for triplet states. Coherent spin states would be optimally preserved in an environment free of nuclear spins, which is achievable in silicon by isotopic purification. Here we report on a deliberately engineered, gate-defined silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot system. The electron occupancy of each dot and the inter-dot tunnel coupling are independently tunable by electrostatic gates. At weak inter-dot coupling we clearly observe Pauli spin blockade and measure a large intra-dot singlet-triplet splitting {\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 1 meV. The leakage current in spin blockade has a peculiar magnetic field dependence, unrelated to electron-nuclear effects and consistent with the effect of spin-flip cotunneling processes.

abstract = {A quantum computer can solve hard problems - such as prime factoring, database searching, and quantum simulation - at the cost of needing to protect fragile quantum states from error. Quantum error correction provides this protection, by distributing a logical state among many physical qubits via quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is an appealing platform, as it allows for constructing large quantum circuits, and is compatible with microfabrication. For superconducting qubits the surface code is a natural choice for error correction, as it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and rapidly-cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: The per-step fidelity threshold is only about 99{\%}. Here, we demonstrate a universal set of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92{\%} and a two-qubit gate fidelity up to 99.4{\%}. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerant threshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first step towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array with nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state using the complete circuit and full set of gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing is a high-fidelity technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum circuits.},

abstract = {Electron spins hold great promise for quantum computation due to their long coherence times. An approach to realize interactions between distant spin-qubits is to use photons as carriers of quantum information. We demonstrate strong coupling between single microwave photons in a NbTiN high impedance cavity and a three-electron spin-qubit in a GaAs triple quantum dot. We resolve the vacuum Rabi mode splitting with a coupling strength of {\$}g/2\backslashpi\backslashsimeq31{\$} MHz and a qubit decoherence of {\$}\backslashgamma{\_}2/2\backslashpi\backslashsimeq 20{\$} MHz. We can tune the decoherence electrostatically and obtain a minimal {\$}\backslashgamma{\_}2/2\backslashpi\backslashsimeq 10{\$} MHz for {\$}g/2\backslashpi\backslashsimeq 23{\$} MHz. The dependence of the qubit-photon coupling strength on the tunable electric dipole moment of the qubit is measured directly using the ac Stark effect. Our demonstration of strong spin-photon interaction is an important step towards coherent long-distance coupling of spin-qubits.},

To generate a single-stranded region, plasmid DNA was nicked with restriction endonuclease in the presence of ethidium bromide with subsequent exonuclease III controlled digestion. The inserted DNA sequences flanked by nucleotide sequences complementary to single-stranded region were annealed with plasmid DNA and E. coli cells were transformed by the resulting heteroduplex molecules. The presented data show the possibility to insert as many as 200 nucleotides. The yield of recombinant DNA varied from 16 to 0.7{\%} as the number of nucleotides inserted correspondingly varied from 15 to 200. The site of insertion does not depend crucially on the localization of the restriction site used.},

These notes aim to provide a non-expert introduction to the field of circuit QED, to give a basic appreciation of the promise and challenges of the field, along with a number of key concepts that will hopefully be useful for the reader who is new to the field and beginning to explore the research literature. They were written as a pedagogical text designed to complement a course delivered to third-year undergraduate students. After a introductory section which discusses why studying circuit QED might be worthwhile and interesting, I introduce the basic theory tools from quantum optics and quantum information which are needed to understand the key elements of circuit QED. I also provide a brief overview of superconductivity, focussing on the concepts which are most relevant to operation in the regimes of interest in circuit QED. I then describe the three main types of superconducting qubits, and finally give a basic introduction to decoherence and mixture and how they relate to quantum behaviour in electronic circuits.},

abstract = {The detection of electron spins associated with single defects in solids is a critical operation for a range of quantum information and measurement applications under development. So far, it has been accomplished for only two defect centres in crystalline solids: phosphorus dopants in silicon, for which electrical read-out based on a single-electron transistor is used, and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, for which optical read-out is used. A spin read-out fidelity of about 90 per cent has been demonstrated with both electrical read-out and optical read-out; however, the thermal limitations of the former and the poor photon collection efficiency of the latter make it difficult to achieve the higher fidelities required for quantum information applications. Here we demonstrate a hybrid approach in which optical excitation is used to change the charge state (conditional on its spin state) of an erbium defect centre in a silicon-based single-electron transistor, and this change is then detected electrically. The high spectral resolution of the optical frequency-addressing step overcomes the thermal broadening limitation of the previous electrical read-out scheme, and the charge-sensing step avoids the difficulties of efficient photon collection. This approach could lead to new architectures for quantum information processing devices and could drastically increase the range of defect centres that can be exploited. Furthermore, the efficient electrical detection of the optical excitation of single sites in silicon represents a significant step towards developing interconnects between optical-based quantum computing and silicon technologies.},

abstract = {Electron spins confined to phosphorus donors in silicon are promising candidates as qubits because of their long coherence times, exceeding seconds in isotopically purified bulk silicon. With the recent demonstrations of initialization, readout and coherent manipulation of individual donor electron spins, the next challenge towards the realization of a Si:P donor-based quantum computer is the demonstration of exchange coupling in two tunnel-coupled phosphorus donors. Spin-to-charge conversion via Pauli spin blockade, an essential ingredient for reading out individual spin states, is challenging in donor-based systems due to the inherently large donor charging energies (∼45 meV), requiring large electric fields ({\textgreater}1 MV m(-1)) to transfer both electron spins onto the same donor. Here, in a carefully characterized double donor-dot device, we directly observe spin blockade of the first few electrons and measure the effective exchange interaction between electron spins in coupled Coulomb-confined systems.},

We find the asymmetric 2P-1P system provides a highly tunable exchange-curve with mitigated J-oscillation, in which 5 orders of magnitude change in the exchange energy can be achieved using a modest range of electric field for 15 nm qubit separation. Compared to the barrier gate control of exchange in the Kane qubit, the detuning gate design reduces the demanding constraints of precise donor separation, gate width, density and location, as a range of J spanning over a few orders of magnitude can be engineered for various donor separations. We have combined a large-scale full band atomistic tight-binding method with a full configuration interaction technique to capture the full two-electron spectrum of gated donors, providing state-of-the-art calculations of exchange energy in 1P-1P and 2P-1P qubits.},

abstract = {Entangling a single spin to the polarization of a single incoming photon, generated by an external source, would open new paradigms in quantum optics such as delayed-photon entanglement, deterministic logic gates or fault-tolerant quantum computing. These perspectives rely on the possibility that a single spin induces a macroscopic rotation of a photon polarization. Such polarization rotations induced by single spins were recently observed, yet limited to a few 10(-3) degrees due to poor spin-photon coupling. Here we report the enhancement by three orders of magnitude of the spin-photon interaction, using a cavity quantum electrodynamics device. A single hole spin in a semiconductor quantum dot is deterministically coupled to a micropillar cavity. The cavity-enhanced coupling between the incoming photons and the solid-state spin results in a polarization rotation by ± 6° when the spin is optically initialized in the up or down state. These results open the way towards a spin-based quantum network.},

The outstanding challenge is to engineer the environment so that it minimally affects the qubit, but still allows qubit control and scalability. Here, we demonstrate a long-lived single-electron spin qubit in a Si/SiGe quantum dot with all-electrical two-axis control. The spin is driven by resonant microwave electric fields in a transverse magnetic field gradient from a local micromagnet, and the spin state is read out in the single-shot mode. Electron spin resonance occurs at two closely spaced frequencies, which we attribute to two valley states. Thanks to the weak hyperfine coupling in silicon, a Ramsey decay timescale of 1 $\mu$s is observed, almost two orders of magnitude longer than the intrinsic timescales in GaAs quantum dots, whereas gate operation times are comparable to those reported in GaAs. The spin echo decay time is ∼40 $\mu$s, both with one and four echo pulses, possibly limited by intervalley scattering. These advances strongly improve the prospects for quantum information processing based on quantum dots.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a 12 quantum dot device fabricated on an undoped Si/SiGe heterostructure as a proof-of-concept for a scalable, linear gate architecture for semiconductor quantum dots. The device consists of 9 quantum dots in a linear array and 3 single quantum dot charge sensors. We show reproducible single quantum dot charging and orbital energies, with standard deviations less than 20{\%} relative to the mean across the 9 dot array. The single quantum dot charge sensors have a charge sensitivity of 8.2 x 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}} e/root(Hz) and allow the investigation of real-time charge dynamics. As a demonstration of the versatility of this device, we use single-shot readout to measure a spin relaxation time T1 = 170 ms at a magnetic field B = 1 T. By reconfiguring the device, we form two capacitively coupled double quantum dots and extract a mutual charging energy of 200 microeV, which indicates that 50 GHz two-qubit gate operation speeds are feasible.},

abstract = {The thesis work discusses the design, realization, characterization and operation of a two-qubit processor implemented using capacitively coupled tunable superconducting qubits of the Transmon type. Each qubit can be manipulated and read out individually using a non-destructive single-shot readout. In addition, a universal-two qubit gate can be implemented using the interaction between the qubits. The processor implements therefore all basic building blocks of a universal two-qubit quantum processor. Using it, we implement the universal √iSWAP two-qubit gate, characterizing the gate operation by quantum process tomography and obtaining a gate fidelity of 90 {\%}. We use this gate to create entangled two-qubit Bell states and perform a test of the CHSH Bell inequality, observing a violation of the classical boundary by 22 standard deviations after correcting for readout errors. Using the implemented two-qubit gate, we run the so-called Grover search algorithm: For two-qubits, this algorithm finds among four elements x ∈ {\{}00, 01, 10, 11{\}} the one element y that solves a search problem encoded by a function f for which f(y) = 1 and f(x ?= y) = 0. Our implementation retrieves the correct answer to the search problem after a single evaluation of the search function f(x), with a success probability between 52 {\%} and 67 {\%}, therefore outperforming classical algorithms that are bound to a success probability of 25 {\%}. This constitutes therefore a proof-of-concept of the quantum speed-up for superconducting quantum processors. Finally, we propose a scalable architecture for a superconducting quantum processor that can potentially overcome the scalability issues faced by today's superconducting qubit architectures.},

We find that these interfaces can be a strong source for two-level state (TLS) losses, when the interfaces are not positioned at current nodes of the resonator. In addition to TLS losses, for resonators including Al, quasiparticle losses become relevant above 200 mK.

Qubits defined by the singlet and triplet states of two exchange coupled quantum dots have recently been shown to possess long coherence times. When the effective nuclear fields in the two asymmetric quantum dots are different, total spin will no longer be a good quantum number and there will be a large electric dipole coupling between the two qubit states. We show that when such a double-quantum-dot qubit is embedded in a superconducting microstrip cavity, the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics lies within reach. Virtual photons in a common cavity mode could mediate coherent interactions between two distant qubits embedded in the same structure; the range of this two-qubit interaction is determined by the wavelength of the microwave transition.},

Graphene quantum dots have been proposed as quantum bits, and their excited-state relaxation rates have been studied experimentally. However, their dephasing rates remain unex- plored. In addition, it is still not clear how to implement long-range interaction among qubits for future scalable graphene quantum computing architectures. Here we report a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) experiment using a graphene double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit and a superconducting reflection-line resonator (RLR). The demonstration of this capacitive coupling between a graphene qubit and a resonator provides a possible approach for me- diating interactions between spatially-separated graphene qubits. Furthermore, taking advantage of sensitive microwave readout measurements using the res- onator, we measure the charge-state dephasing rates in our hybrid graphene nanostructure, which is found to be of the order of GHz. A spectral anal- ysis method is also developed to simultaneously extract: the DQD-resonator coupling strength, the tunneling rate between the DQD charge states, and the charge-state dephasing rate. Our results show that this graphene cQED archi- tecture can be a compelling platform for both graphene physics research and potential applications.},

We discuss the recent results on vacuum Rabi splitting with a single quantum dot, emphasizing the differences from quantum-well systems. Finally, we propose nonlinear tests for the true quantum limit and speculate about applications in quantum information devices.},

abstract = {Superconducting circuits are promising candidates for constructing quantum bits (qubits) in a quantum computer; single-qubit operations are now routine, and several examples of two qubit interactions and gates having been demonstrated. These experiments show that two nearby qubits can be readily coupled with local interactions. Performing gates between an arbitrary pair of distant qubits is highly desirable for any quantum computer architecture, but has not yet been demonstrated. An efficient way to achieve this goal is to couple the qubits to a quantum bus, which distributes quantum information among the qubits. Here we show the implementation of such a quantum bus, using microwave photons confined in a transmission line cavity, to couple two superconducting qubits on opposite sides of a chip. The interaction is mediated by the exchange of virtual rather than real photons, avoiding cavity induced loss. Using fast control of the qubits to switch the coupling effectively on and off, we demonstrate coherent transfer of quantum states between the qubits. The cavity is also used to perform multiplexed control and measurement of the qubit states. This approach can be expanded to more than two qubits, and is an attractive architecture for quantum information processing on a chip.},

@article{Jaynes1963,
abstract = { This paper has two purposes: 1) to clarify the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation, where the electromagnetic field-expansion coefficients satisfy commutation relations, and the semiclassical theory, where the electromagnetic field is considered as a definite function of time rather than as an operator; and 2) to apply some of the results in a study of amplitude and frequency stability in a molecular beam maser. In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h {\&}{\#}937; to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the -$\backslash$noscillation frequency. The existence of "noise enhancing" and "noise quieting" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.},

Superconducting qubits made with scalable microfabrication techniques are a promising candidate for the realization of a large-scale quantum information processor. Although these systems have successfully passed tests of coherent coupling for up to four qubits, communication of individual quantum states between superconducting qubits via a quantum bus has not yet been realized. Here, we perform an experiment demonstrating the ability to coherently transfer quantum states between two superconducting Josephson phase qubits through a quantum bus. This quantum bus is a resonant cavity formed by an open-ended superconducting transmission line of length 7 mm. After preparing an initial quantum state with the first qubit, this quantum information is transferred and stored as a nonclassical photon state of the resonant cavity, then retrieved later by the second qubit connected to the opposite end of the cavity. Beyond simple state transfer, these results suggest that a high-quality-factor superconducting cavity could also function as a useful short-term memory element. The basic architecture presented here can be expanded, offering the possibility for the coherent interaction of a large number of superconducting qubits.},

Coupling between distant quantum-dot spins, in one and the same or different nanowires, can be efficiently performed via the resonator mode either in real time or through virtual processes. For the latter case, we derive an effective spin-entangling interaction and suggest means to turn it on and off. We consider both transverse and longitudinal types of nanowire quantum dots and compare their manipulation time scales against the spin relaxation times. For this, we evaluate the rates for spin relaxation induced by the nanowire vibrations (phonons) and show that, as a result of phonon confinement in the nanowire, this rate is a strongly varying function of the spin operation frequency and thus can be drastically reduced compared to lateral quantum dots in GaAs. Our scheme is a step forward to the formation of hybrid structures where qubits of different nature can be integrated in a single device.},

Here we demonstrate a simple detection scheme in which a radio frequency resonant circuit coupled to a semiconductor double quantum dot is used to probe its charge and spin states. These results demonstrate a new noninvasive technique for measuring charge and spin states in quantum dot systems without requiring a separate mesoscopic detector.},

@article{Bennett2015,
abstract = {The notion that the electromagnetic field is quantised is usually inferred from observations such as the photoelectric effect and the black-body spectrum. However accounts of the quantisation of this field are usually mathematically motivated and begin by introducing a vector potential, followed by the imposition of a gauge that allows the manipulation of the solutions of Maxwell's equations into a form that is amenable for the machinery of canonical quantisation. By contrast, here we quantise the electromagnetic field in a less mathematically and more physically-motivated way. Starting from a direct description of what one sees in experiments, we show that the usual expressions of the electric and magnetic field observables follow from Heisenberg's equation of motion. In our treatment, there is no need to invoke the vector potential in a specific gauge, nor do we need to consider a finite quantisation volume before being able to go to the infinite-volume limit.},

@article{Raimond2001,
abstract = {After they have interacted, quantum particles generally behave as a single nonseparable entangled system. The concept of entanglement plays an essential role in quantum physics. We have performed entanglement experiments with Rydberg atoms and microwave photons in a cavity and tested quantum mechanics in situations of increasing complexity. Entanglement resulted either from a resonant exchange of energy between atoms and the cavity field or from dispersive energy shifts affecting atoms and photons when they were not resonant. With two entangled particles (two atoms or one atom and a photon), we have realized new versions of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen situation. The detection of one particle projected the other, at a distance, in a correlated state. This process could be viewed as an elementary measurement, one particle being a ''meter'' measuring the other. We have performed a ''quantum nondemolition'' measurement of a single photon, which we detected repeatedly without destroying it. Entanglement is also essential to understand decoherence, the process accounting for the classical appearance of the macroscopic world. A mesoscopic superposition of states (''Schr{\"{o}} dinger cat'') gets rapidly entangled with its environment, losing its quantum coherence. We have prepared a Schr{\"{o}} dinger cat made of a few photons and studied the dynamics of its decoherence, in an experiment which constitutes a glimpse at the quantum/classical boundary. We have also investigated entanglement as a resource for the processing of quantum information. By using quantum two-state systems (qubits) instead of classical bits of information, one can perform logical operations exploiting quantum interferences and taking advantage of the properties of entanglement. Manipulating as qubits atoms and photons in a cavity, we have operated a quantum gate and applied it to the generation of a complex three-particle entangled state. We finally discuss the perspectives opened by these experiments for further fundamental studies.},

This implies programmable sequences of operations to generate and analyze the entanglement of complex systems. We have demonstrated such a procedure for two atoms and a single-photon cavity mode, engineering and analyzing a three-particle entangled state by a succession of controlled steps that address the particles individually. This entangling procedure can, in principle, operate on larger numbers of particles, opening new perspectives for fundamental tests of quantum theory.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the work on cavity quantum electrodynamics of free atoms. In recent years, cavity experiments have also been conducted on a variety of solid-state systems resulting in many interesting applications, of which microlasers, photon bandgap structures and quantum dot structures in cavities are outstanding examples. Although these phenomena and systems are very interesting, discussion is limited here to free atoms and mostly single atoms because these systems exhibit clean quantum phenomena and are not disturbed by a variety of other effects. At the centre of our review is the work on the one-atom maser, but we also give a survey of the entire field, using free atoms in order to show the large variety of problems dealt with. The cavity interaction can be separated into two main regimes: the weak coupling in cavity or cavity-like structures with low quality factors Q and the strong coupling when high-Q cavities are involved. The weak coupling leads to modification of spontaneous transitions and level shifts, whereas the strong coupling enables one to observe a periodic exchange of photons between atoms and the radiation field. In this case, atoms and photons are entangled, this being the basis for a variety of phenomena observed, some of them leading to interesting applications in quantum information processing. The cavity experiments with free atoms reached a new domain with the advent of experiments in the visible spectral region. A review on recent achievements in this area is also given.},

To combine these resources, it is desirable to achieve the coherent coupling of a single spin to photons stored in a superconducting resonator. Using a circuit design based on a nanoscale spin valve, we coherently hybridize the individual spin and charge states of a double quantum dot while preserving spin coherence. This scheme allows us to achieve spin-photon coupling up to the megahertz range at the single-spin level. The cooperativity is found to reach 2.3, and the spin coherence time is about 60 nanoseconds. We thereby demonstrate a mesoscopic device suitable for nondestructive spin readout and distant spin coupling.},

abstract = {Graphene has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its unique physical properties and potential applications. Graphene quantum dots have been proposed as quantum bits, and their excited-state relaxation rates have been studied experimentally. However, their dephasing rates remain unex- plored. In addition, it is still not clear how to implement long-range interaction among qubits for future scalable graphene quantum computing architectures. Here we report a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) experiment using a graphene double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit and a superconducting reflection-line resonator (RLR). The demonstration of this capacitive coupling between a graphene qubit and a resonator provides a possible approach for me- diating interactions between spatially-separated graphene qubits. Furthermore, taking advantage of sensitive microwave readout measurements using the res- onator, we measure the charge-state dephasing rates in our hybrid graphene nanostructure, which is found to be of the order of GHz. A spectral anal- ysis method is also developed to simultaneously extract: the DQD-resonator coupling strength, the tunneling rate between the DQD charge states, and the charge-state dephasing rate. Our results show that this graphene cQED archi- tecture can be a compelling platform for both graphene physics research and potential applications.},

The spin-flip process is revealed in the decay dynamics following nongeminate excitation. We are able to control the spin-flip rate by more than an order of magnitude simply with a dc voltage. The spin-flip mechanism involves a spin exchange with the Fermi sea in the back contact of our device and corresponds to the high temperature Kondo regime. We use the Anderson Hamiltonian to calculate a spin-flip rate, and we find excellent agreement with the experimental results.},

abstract = {Information processing using quantum systems provides new paradigms for computation and communication and may yield insights into our understanding of the limits of quantum mechanics. However, realistic systems are never perfectly isolated from their environment, hence all quantum operations are subject to errors. Realization of a physical system for processing of quantum information that is tolerant of errors is a fundamental problem in quantum science and engineering. Here, we develop an architecture for quantum computation using electrically controlled semiconductor spins by extending the Loss–DiVincenzo scheme and by combining actively protected quantum memory and long-distance coupling mechanisms. Our approach is based on a demonstrated encoding of qubits in long-lived two-electron states, which immunizes qubits against the dominant error from hyperfine interactions. We develop a universal set of quantum gates compatible with active error suppression for these encoded qubits and an effective long-range interaction between the qubits by controlled electron transport. This approach yields a scalable architecture with favourable error thresholds for fault-tolerant operation, consistent with present experimental parameters.},

Coupling neighbouring spins via the natural exchange interaction according to current designs requires gate control structures with extremely small length scales. We present a silicon architecture where bismuth donors with long coherence times are coupled to electrons that can shuttle between adjacent quantum dots, thus relaxing the pitch requirements and allowing space between donors for classical control devices. An adiabatic SWAP operation within each donor/dot pair solves the scalability issues intrinsic to exchange-based two-qubit gates, as it does not rely on sub-nanometer precision in donor placement and is robust against noise in the control fields. We use this SWAP together with well established global microwave Rabi pulses and parallel electron shuttling to construct a surface code that needs minimal, feasible local control.},

abstract = {Individual impurity atoms in silicon can make superb individual qubits, but it remains an immense challenge to build a multi-qubit processor: There is a basic conflict between nanometre separation desired for qubit-qubit interactions, and the much larger scales that would enable control and addressing in a manufacturable and fault tolerant architecture. Here we resolve this conflict by establishing the feasibility of surface code quantum computing using solid state spins, or `data qubits', that are widely separated from one another. We employ a second set of `probe' spins which are mechanically separate from the data qubits and move in-and-out of their proximity. The spin dipole-dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe's total phase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe's path. We introduce a protocol to balance the systematic errors due to the spins being imperfectly located during device fabrication. Detailed simulations show that the surface code's threshold then corresponds to misalignments that are substantial on the scale of the array, indicating that it is very robust. We conclude that this simple `orbital probe' architecture overcomes many of the difficulties facing solid state quantum computing, while minimising the complexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude greater than other systems.},

abstract = {Spin is a quantum mechanical property that describes the magnetic orientation of elementary and composite particles such as electrons and nuclei. For “spin-half” particles placed in a magnetic field, two states with differing energies are defined. Proposals exist for developing a revolutionary kind of computer that encodes bits of information on the states of a simple quantum two-level system – like those of a spin in a magnetic field. These “quantum computers” exploit the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics in order to perform certain calculations expo- nentially faster than their classical counterparts. Key to the development of such a device is the identification of potential systems that are suitable for employment as a quantum bit (qubit). This thesis explores quantum bits constructed from the spin states of single atoms hosted in silicon semiconductor devices. Silicon is an exceptional platform for spin-based quantum computing – in addition to being the dominant material in the microelectronic industry, it is also predominantly composed of nuclear spin-zero isotopes, providing very little background magnetic disturbance. The donor-atom phosphorus (31P) is investigated here. It possesses a nucleus that binds an additional electron to its positive charge, providing two distinct spin qubits. Here, several world-first experimental milestones in spin-based quantum in- formation processing are reported. First, the readout of the electron spin is demonstrated in single-shot, using a silicon device which combines implanted phosphorus donors with a sensitive nanoscale electrometer. Then, the electron spin is coherently operated as a qubit by delivering on-chip microwave excitations. Combining the electron spin detection and control capabilities enables a quan- tum non-demolition measurement of the single 31P nuclear spin. Experiments yield exceptional nuclear readout fidelities – the highest for any solid-state qubit. Through an application of nuclear magnetic resonance, high-fidelity quantum control of the nuclear spin qubit is demonstrated. Finally, a single spin-bearing silicon nucleus (29Si) coupled to the electron spin is detected in single-shot and operated as a qubit. These results, along with the clear pathways identified for improving device performance, illustrate that single-atom electron and nuclear spin qubits in silicon constitute an excellent basis on which to construct a quan- tum computer.},

abstract = {A single atom is the prototypical quantum system, and a natural candidate for a quantum bit, or qubit--the elementary unit of a quantum computer. Atoms have been successfully used to store and process quantum information in electromagnetic traps, as well as in diamond through the use of the nitrogen-vacancy-centre point defect. Solid-state electrical devices possess great potential to scale up such demonstrations from few-qubit control to larger-scale quantum processors. Coherent control of spin qubits has been achieved in lithographically defined double quantum dots in both GaAs (refs 3-5) and Si (ref. 6). However, it is a formidable challenge to combine the electrical measurement capabilities of engineered nanostructures with the benefits inherent in atomic spin qubits. Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin qubit bound to a phosphorus donor atom in natural silicon, measured electrically via single-shot read-out. We use electron spin resonance to drive Rabi oscillations, and a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence time exceeding 200 µs. This time should be even longer in isotopically enriched (28)Si samples. Combined with a device architecture that is compatible with modern integrated circuit technology, the electron spin of a single phosphorus atom in silicon should be an excellent platform on which to build a scalable quantum computer.},

We estimate that the flip-flop qubit relaxation time can be of the order of {\$}100 \backslash, \backslashmu\backslashtext{\{}s{\}}{\$}, 8 orders of magnitude shorter than the value for an on-donor electron in bulk silicon, and a few orders of magnitude shorter (longer) than the predicted inhomogeneous dephasing time (gate times).

The effective magnetic detuning of the two electron qubits is provided by the hyperfine interaction when the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}31{\}}{\$}P nuclei are prepared in opposite spin states. This can be exploited to switch on and off SWAP operations with modest tuning of the electron exchange interaction. Furthermore, the hyperfine detuning enables high-fidelity conditional rotation gates based on selective resonant excitation. The latter requires no dynamic tuning of the exchange interaction at all, and offers a very attractive scheme to implement two-qubit logic gates under realistic experimental conditions.},

Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin qubit bound to a phosphorus donor atom in natural silicon, measured electrically via single-shot read-out. We use electron spin resonance to drive Rabi oscillations, and a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence time exceeding 200 µs. This time should be even longer in isotopically enriched (28)Si samples. Combined with a device architecture that is compatible with modern integrated circuit technology, the electron spin of a single phosphorus atom in silicon should be an excellent platform on which to build a scalable quantum computer.},

abstract = {The spin of an electron or a nucleus in a semiconductor [1] naturally implements the unit of quantum information -- the qubit -- while providing a technological link to the established electronics industry [2]. The solid-state environment, however, may provide deleterious interactions between the qubit and the nuclear spins of surrounding atoms [3], or charge and spin fluctuators in defects, oxides and interfaces [4]. For group IV materials such as silicon, enrichment of the spin-zero 28-Si isotope drastically reduces spin-bath decoherence [5]. Experiments on bulk spin ensembles in 28-Si crystals have indeed demonstrated extraordinary coherence times [6-8]. However, it remained unclear whether these would persist at the single-spin level, in gated nanostructures near amorphous interfaces. Here we present the coherent operation of individual 31-P electron and nuclear spin qubits in a top-gated nanostructure, fabricated on an isotopically engineered 28-Si substrate. We report new benchmarks for coherence time ({\textgreater} 30 seconds) and control fidelity ({\textgreater} 99.99{\%}) of any single qubit in solid state, and perform a detailed noise spectroscopy [9] to demonstrate that -- contrary to widespread belief -- the coherence is not limited by the proximity to an interface. Our results represent a fundamental advance in control and understanding of spin qubits in nanostructures.},

We apply this analysis to the electron and the ionized (31)P nucleus of a single P donor in isotopically purified (28)Si. We find average gate fidelities of 99.95{\%} for the electron and 99.99{\%} for the nuclear spin. These values are above certain error correction thresholds and demonstrate the potential of donor-based quantum computing in silicon. By studying the influence of the shape and power of the control pulses, we find evidence that the present limitation to the gate fidelity is mostly related to the external hardware and not the intrinsic behaviour of the qubit.},

abstract = {We consider nuclear spin dynamics in a two-electron double dot system near the intersection of the electron spin singlet {\$}S{\$} and the lower energy component {\$}T{\_}{\{}+{\}}{\$} of the spin triplet. The electron spin interacts with nuclear spins and is influenced by the spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is based on a quantum description of the electron spin in combination with the coherent semiclassical dynamics of nuclear spins. We consider single and double Landau-Zener passages across the {\$}S{\$}-{\$}T{\_}{\{}+{\}}{\$} anticrossings. For linear sweeps, the electron dynamics is expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The dynamical nuclear polarization is described by two complex conjugate functions {\$}\backslashLambda {\^{}}{\{}\backslashpm{\}}{\$} related to the integrals of the products of the singlet and triplet amplitudes {\$}{\{}\backslashtilde{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}S{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\{}\backslashtilde{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}T{\_}{\{}+{\}}{\}}{\$} along the sweep. The real part {\$}P{\$} of {\$}\backslashLambda {\^{}}{\{}\backslashpm{\}}{\$} is related to the {\$}S{\$}-{\$}T{\_}{\{}+{\}}{\$} spin-transition probability, accumulates in the vicinity of the anticrossing, and for long linear passages coincides with the Landau-Zener probability {\$}P{\_}{\{}LZ{\}}=1-e{\^{}}{\{}-2\backslashpi \backslashgamma{\}}{\$}, where {\$}\backslashgamma {\$} is the Landau-Zener parameter. The imaginary part {\$}Q{\$} of {\$}\backslashLambda{\^{}}{\{}+{\}}{\$} is specific for the nuclear spin dynamics, accumulates during the whole sweep, and for {\$}\backslashgamma \backslashgtrsim 1{\$} is typically an order of magnitude larger than {\$}P{\$}. {\$}Q{\$} has a profound effect on the nuclear spin dynamics, by (i) causing intensive shake-up processes among the nuclear spins and (ii) producing a high nuclear spin generation rate when the hyperfine and spin-orbit interactions are comparable in magnitude. We find analytical expressions for the back-action of the nuclear reservoir represented via the change in the Overhauser fields the electron subsystem experiences.},

abstract = {Detection of nuclear spin precession is critical for a wide range of scientific techniques that have applications in diverse fields including analytical chemistry, materials science, medicine and biology. Fundamentally, it is possible because of the extreme isolation of nuclear spins from their environment. This isolation also makes single nuclear spins desirable for quantum-information processing, as shown by pioneering studies on nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. The nuclear spin of a (31)P donor in silicon is very promising as a quantum bit: bulk measurements indicate that it has excellent coherence times and silicon is the dominant material in the microelectronics industry. Here we demonstrate electrical detection and coherent manipulation of a single (31)P nuclear spin qubit with sufficiently high fidelities for fault-tolerant quantum computing. By integrating single-shot readout of the electron spin with on-chip electron spin resonance, we demonstrate quantum non-demolition and electrical single-shot readout of the nuclear spin with a readout fidelity higher than 99.8 percent-the highest so far reported for any solid-state qubit. The single nuclear spin is then operated as a qubit by applying coherent radio-frequency pulses. For an ionized (31)P donor, we find a nuclear spin coherence time of 60 milliseconds and a one-qubit gate control fidelity exceeding 98 percent. These results demonstrate that the dominant technology of modern electronics can be adapted to host a complete electrical measurement and control platform for nuclear-spin-based quantum-information processing.},

Although fast, 180-picosecond, two-quantum-bit (two-qubit) operations can be realized using nearest-neighbour exchange coupling, a scalable, spin-based quantum computing architecture will almost certainly require long-range qubit interactions. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) allows spatially separated superconducting qubits to interact via a superconducting microwave cavity that acts as a 'quantum bus', making possible two-qubit entanglement and the implementation of simple quantum algorithms. Here we combine the cQED architecture with spin qubits by coupling an indium arsenide nanowire double quantum dot to a superconducting cavity. The architecture allows us to achieve a charge-cavity coupling rate of about 30 megahertz, consistent with coupling rates obtained in gallium arsenide quantum dots. Furthermore, the strong spin-orbit interaction of indium arsenide allows us to drive spin rotations electrically with a local gate electrode, and the charge-cavity interaction provides a measurement of the resulting spin dynamics. Our results demonstrate how the cQED architecture can be used as a sensitive probe of single-spin physics and that a spin-cavity coupling rate of about one megahertz is feasible, presenting the possibility of long-range spin coupling via superconducting microwave cavities.},

This is accomplished by incorporating dc bias lines into the cavity at specific locations. The measured S -matrix parameters of the system are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and simulations. We find that at 4 K the quality factor of the cavity degrades by less than 1{\%} under the application of a dc bias.},

In combination with the recently demonstrated controlled exchange gate between two neighbouring spins, driven coherent single spin rotations would permit universal quantum operations. Here, we report the experimental realization of single electron spin rotations in a double quantum dot. First, we apply a continuous-wave oscillating magnetic field, generated on-chip, and observe electron spin resonance in spin-dependent transport measurements through the two dots. Next, we coherently control the quantum state of the electron spin by applying short bursts of the oscillating magnetic field and observe about eight oscillations of the spin state (so-called Rabi oscillations) during a microsecond burst. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating single-electron spins in a quantum dot as quantum bits.},

abstract = {The size of silicon transistors used in microelectronic devices is shrinking to the level at which quantum effects become important. Although this presents a significant challenge for the further scaling of microprocessors, it provides the potential for radical innovations in the form of spin-based quantum computers and spintronic devices. An electron spin in silicon can represent a well-isolated quantum bit with long coherence times because of the weak spin-orbit coupling and the possibility of eliminating nuclear spins from the bulk crystal. However, the control of single electrons in silicon has proved challenging, and so far the observation and manipulation of a single spin has been impossible. Here we report the demonstration of single-shot, time-resolved readout of an electron spin in silicon. This has been performed in a device consisting of implanted phosphorus donors coupled to a metal-oxide-semiconductor single-electron transistor-compatible with current microelectronic technology. We observed a spin lifetime of ∼6 seconds at a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla, and achieved a spin readout fidelity better than 90 per cent. High-fidelity single-shot spin readout in silicon opens the way to the development of a new generation of quantum computing and spintronic devices, built using the most important material in the semiconductor industry.},

abstract = {Unwanted interaction between a quantum system and its fluctuating environment leads to decoherence and is the primary obstacle to establishing a scalable quantum information processing architecture. Strategies such as environmental and materials engineering, quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling can mitigate decoherence, but generally increase experimental complexity. Here we improve coherence in a qubit using real-time Hamiltonian parameter estimation. Using a rapidly converging Bayesian approach, we precisely measure the splitting in a singlet-triplet spin qubit faster than the surrounding nuclear bath fluctuates. We continuously adjust qubit control parameters based on this information, thereby improving the inhomogenously broadened coherence time (T2*) from tens of nanoseconds to {\textgreater}2 $\mu$s. Because the technique demonstrated here is compatible with arbitrary qubit operations, it is a natural complement to quantum error correction and can be used to improve the performance of a wide variety of qubits in both meteorological and quantum information processing applications.},

abstract = {Artificial molecules containing just one or two electrons provide a powerful platform for studies of orbital and spin quantum dynamics in nanoscale devices. A well-known example of these dynamics is tunnelling of electrons between two coupled quantum dots triggered by microwave irradiation. So far, these tunnelling processes have been treated as electric-dipole-allowed spin-conserving events. Here we report that microwaves can also excite tunnelling transitions between states with different spin. We show that the dominant mechanism responsible for violation of spin conservation is the spin-orbit interaction. These transitions make it possible to perform detailed microwave spectroscopy of the molecular spin states of an artificial hydrogen molecule and open up the possibility of realizing full quantum control of a two-spin system through microwave excitation.},

abstract = {Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems faster than classical computers. To exploit their power, it is necessary to perform interqubit operations and generate entangled states. Spin qubits are a promising candidate for implementing a quantum processor because of their potential for scalability and miniaturization. However, their weak interactions with the environment, which lead to their long coherence times, make interqubit operations challenging. We performed a controlled two-qubit operation between singlet-triplet qubits using a dynamically decoupled sequence that maintains the two-qubit coupling while decoupling each qubit from its fluctuating environment. Using state tomography, we measured the full density matrix of the system and determined the concurrence and the fidelity of the generated state, providing proof of entanglement.},

abstract = {Determining classically whether a coin is fair (head on one side, tail on the other) or fake (heads or tails on both sides) requires an examination of each side. However, the analogous quantum procedure (the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm) requires just one examination step. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has been realized experimentally using bulk nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, employing nuclear spins as quantum bits (qubits). In contrast, the ion trap processor utilises motional and electronic quantum states of individual atoms as qubits, and in principle is easier to scale to many qubits. Experimental advances in the latter area include the realization of a two-qubit quantum gate, the entanglement of four ions, quantum state engineering and entanglement-enhanced phase estimation. Here we exploit techniques developed for nuclear magnetic resonance to implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on an ion-trap quantum processor, using as qubits the electronic and motional states of a single calcium ion. Our ion-based implementation of a full quantum algorithm serves to demonstrate experimental procedures with the quality and precision required for complex computations, confirming the potential of trapped ions for quantum computation.},

The cluster expansion produces the two-point correlation function of the approximate classical bath, permitting rapid evaluation of noise-mitigating quantum control strategies without resorting to computationally intensive dynamical decoupling models. Our approximation is valid for the wide class of models possessing negligible back-action and nearly-Gaussian noise. We study several instances of the central spin decoherence problem in which the central spin and randomly-located bath spins are alike and dipolarly coupled. For various pulse sequences, we compare the coherence echo decay computed explicitly quantum mechanically versus those computed using our approximate classical model, and obtain agreement in most, but not all, cases. We demonstrate the utility of these classical noise models by efficiently searching for the 4-pulse sequences that maximally mitigate decoherence in each of these cases, a computationally expensive task in the explicit quantum model.},

@article{Xu2009,
abstract = {A single electron or hole spin trapped inside a semiconductor quantum dot forms the foundation for many proposed quantum logic devices. In group III-V materials, the resonance and coherence between two ground states of the single spin are inevitably affected by the lattice nuclear spins through the hyperfine interaction, while the dynamics of the single spin also influence the nuclear environment. Recent efforts have been made to protect the coherence of spins in quantum dots by suppressing the nuclear spin fluctuations. However, coherent control of a single spin in a single dot with simultaneous suppression of the nuclear fluctuations has yet to be achieved. Here we report the suppression of nuclear field fluctuations in a singly charged quantum dot to well below the thermal value, as shown by an enhancement of the single electron spin dephasing time T(2)*, which we measure using coherent dark-state spectroscopy. The suppression of nuclear fluctuations is found to result from a hole-spin assisted dynamic nuclear spin polarization feedback process, where the stable value of the nuclear field is determined only by the laser frequencies at fixed laser powers. This nuclear field locking is further demonstrated in a three-laser measurement, indicating a possible enhancement of the electron spin T(2)* by a factor of several hundred. This is a simple and powerful method of enhancing the electron spin coherence time without use of 'spin echo'-type techniques. We expect that our results will enable the reproducible preparation of the nuclear spin environment for repetitive control and measurement of a single spin with minimal statistical broadening.},

Physical mechanisms leading to this relaxation of spin memory typically involve either coupling of the electron spin to its orbital motion or to nuclear spins. Relaxation of confined electron spin has been previously measured only for Zeeman or exchange split spin states, where spin-orbit effects dominate relaxation; spin flips due to nuclei have been observed in optical spectroscopy studies. Using an isolated GaAs double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gates and direct time domain measurements, we investigate in detail spin relaxation for arbitrary splitting of spin states. Here we show that electron spin flips are dominated by nuclear interactions and are slowed by several orders of magnitude when a magnetic field of a few millitesla is applied. These results have significant implications for spin-based information processing.},

Electrical control instead of magnetic control is particularly appealing for this purpose, because electric fields are easy to generate locally on-chip. We experimentally realized coherent control of a single-electron spin in a quantum dot using an oscillating electric field generated by a local gate. The electric field induced coherent transitions (Rabi oscillations) between spin-up and spin-down with 90 degrees rotations as fast as approximately 55 nanoseconds. Our analysis indicated that the electrically induced spin transitions were mediated by the spin-orbit interaction. Taken together with the recently demonstrated coherent exchange of two neighboring spins, our results establish the feasibility of fully electrical manipulation of spin qubits.},

These techniques are based on rapid electrical control of the exchange interaction. Separating and later recombining a singlet spin state provided a measurement of the spin dephasing time, T2*, of approximately 10 nanoseconds, limited by hyperfine interactions with the gallium arsenide host nuclei. Rabi oscillations of two-electron spin states were demonstrated, and spin-echo pulse sequences were used to suppress hyperfine-induced dephasing. Using these quantum control techniques, a coherence time for two-electron spin states exceeding 1 microsecond was observed.},

Dynamic nuclear polarization in semiconductors is commonly achieved in the presence of a stabilizing external magnetic field. Here we report efficient optical pumping of nuclear spins at zero magnetic field in strain-free GaAs quantum dots. The strong interaction of a single, optically injected electron spin with the nuclear spins acts as a stabilizing, effective magnetic field (Knight field) on the nuclei. We optically tune the Knight field amplitude and direction. In combination with a small transverse magnetic field, we are able to control the longitudinal and transverse components of the nuclear spin polarization in the absence of lattice strain--that is, in dots with strongly reduced static nuclear quadrupole effects, as reproduced by our model calculations.},

@article{Rashba2008,
abstract = {Very recently, the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) of single electrons in quantum dots was discovered by three independent experimental groups. Remarkably, these observations revealed three different mechanisms of EDSR: coupling of electron spin to its momentum (spin-orbit), to the operator of its position (inhomogeneous Zeeman coupling), and to the hyperfine Overhauser field of nuclear spins. In this paper, I present a unified microscopic theory of these resonances in quantum dots. A mean field theory, derived for all three mechanisms and based on retaining only two-spin correlators, justifies applying macroscopic description of nuclear polarization to the EDSR theory. In the framework of the mean field theory, a fundamental difference in the time dependence of EDSR inherent of these mechanisms is revealed; it changes from the Rabi-type oscillations to a nearly monotonic growth. The theory provides a regular procedure to account for the higher nuclear-spin correlators that become of importance for a wider time span and can change the asymptotic behavior of EDSR. It also allows revealing the effect of electron spin dynamics on the effective coupling between nuclear spins.},

@article{Greilich2007,
abstract = {The hyperfine interaction of an electron with the nuclei is considered as the primary obstacle to coherent control of the electron spin in semiconductor quantum dots. We show, however, that the nuclei in singly charged quantum dots act constructively by focusing the electron spin precession about a magnetic field into well-defined modes synchronized with a laser pulse protocol. In a dot with a synchronized electron, the light-stimulated fluctuations of the hyperfine nuclear field acting on the electron are suppressed. The information about electron spin precession is imprinted in the nuclei and thereby can be stored for tens of minutes in darkness. The frequency focusing drives an electron spin ensemble into dephasing-free subspaces with the potential to realize single frequency precession of the entire ensemble.},

abstract = {We demonstrated coherent control of a quantum two-level system based on two-electron spin states in a double quantum dot, allowing state preparation, coherent manipulation, and projective readout. These techniques are based on rapid electrical control of the exchange interaction. Separating and later recombining a singlet spin state provided a measurement of the spin dephasing time, T2*, of approximately 10 nanoseconds, limited by hyperfine interactions with the gallium arsenide host nuclei. Rabi oscillations of two-electron spin states were demonstrated, and spin-echo pulse sequences were used to suppress hyperfine-induced dephasing. Using these quantum control techniques, a coherence time for two-electron spin states exceeding 1 microsecond was observed.},

@article{Gao2012,
abstract = {Entanglement has a central role in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics as well as in the burgeoning field of quantum information processing. Particularly in the context of quantum networks and communication, a main challenge is the efficient generation of entanglement between stationary (spin) and propagating (photon) quantum bits. Here we report the observation of quantum entanglement between a semiconductor quantum dot spin and the colour of a propagating optical photon. The demonstration of entanglement relies on the use of fast, single-photon detection, which allows us to project the photon into a superposition of red and blue frequency components. Our results extend the previous demonstrations of single-spin/single-photon entanglement in trapped ions, neutral atoms and nitrogen-vacancy centres to the domain of artificial atoms in semiconductor nanostructures that allow for on-chip integration of electronic and photonic elements. As a result of its fast optical transitions and favourable selection rules, the scheme we implement could in principle generate nearly deterministic entangled spin-photon pairs at a rate determined ultimately by the high spontaneous emission rate. Our observation constitutes a first step towards implementation of a quantum network with nodes consisting of semiconductor spin quantum bits.},
