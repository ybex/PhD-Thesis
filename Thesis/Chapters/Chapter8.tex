        %A fight is not won by one punch or kick. Either learn to endure or hire a bodyguard.   It's the journey that mattered, not the destination. Bruce Lee   No PhD student ever “The way up to the top of the mountain is always longer than you think. Don’t fool yourself, the moment will arrive when what seemed so near is still very far.” — Paulo Coelho
